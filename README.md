Need to evaluate [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) in Swift? This package is for you.



### Examples

```swift
let roll = Roll("1d20")!.roll()
roll.result
// $R0: Int = 18

let roll = Roll("3d8+1d6")!.roll()
roll.result
// $R0: Int = 19
roll.expression
// $R1: String = "1+6+7+5"

D(20).average
// $R0: Double = 10.5
```

The rest of the API is pretty self-explanatory. `D`ice and `Roll`s have attributes for accessing the max, half and average values of their rolls. Use the `roll()` function to actually throw the dice on both of these types and get some random values. 

That's pretty much it, cheers üçª



### CLI

This package also includes a small CLI to roll the dice directly in your terminal.

```bash
$ d20 2d6+4
# 14 (6+4)+4

$ alias dagger='d20 1d4+2'
$ dagger
# 6 (4)+2
# CRIT!
```



Installing it is easy. Just run the following after cloning the repo.

```bash
$ swift build -c release
$ cp .build/release/d20 /usr/local/bin/d20
```
